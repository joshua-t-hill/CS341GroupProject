Sprint2 Changes:
	Added 'users' table, with columns 'name','password', and 'email'
	Added some functionality to LoginPage
	Added some fucntionality to CreateAccountPage

	Moved all pages besides App and AppShell into Pages folder for organization purposes
	Added icons and made tab names more compact for Map, Camera, and Feed tabs; reduced amount of tabs :) :)
	Set up project database and put access information in Constants.cs
	Designed and implemented a table for MapPage to store Pin information with consideration for future feature implementation :) :) :)
	Researched Pin event handlers to customize on-tap actions; wasn't able to get working as planned so commented out for later reference
	Leverage generic information window for on-tap event on Pins to show plant names and unique ID numbers fetched dynamically from SQL database; not final design :)
